# Advanced C++ Calendar

This is a console-based calendar application built using C++.
I created this project to understand date logic, leap years, and basic system-level programming.

## Features
- View full year calendar
- View individual month
- Interactive month navigation (W/A/S/D keys)
- Leap year handling
- Weekend and today highlighting
- Colored console interface
- Runs in CMD, PowerShell, and VS Code

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Windows API (windows.h)
- Standard C++ libraries

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
g++ calendar.cpp -o calendar

2. Run:
calendar

## Controls (Interactive Mode)
- A → Previous Month
- D → Next Month
- W → Next Year
- S → Previous Year
- Q → Quit

## Why I Built This
I wanted to go beyond basic C++ programs and build something interactive.
This project helped me understand real-world date calculations, user input handling, and clean console UI design.

## Future Improvements
- Add event reminders
- Save user notes
- Convert to OOP
- Cross-platform version
